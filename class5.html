            Bangladesh is a small and beautiful country in South Asia. 
            We got independence in 1971 from Pakistan after a long war.
             Because of the sacrifice of millions of freedom fighters we got this country.
              16 December is our Victory Day because this day the Pakistani army surrendered.
